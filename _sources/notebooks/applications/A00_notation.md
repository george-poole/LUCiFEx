# Notation

In these notebooks covering applications to fluid dynamics a consistent notation shall be used as far as possible, extending the notation introduced previously.

| Symbol(s) | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| $\textbf{u}$ | fluid velocity |
| $p$| pressure |
| $\psi$| streamfunction |
| $\rho$ | fluid density |
| $\mu$ | fluid viscosity |
| $\textbf{f}$ | body force |
| $g$ | gravity constant |
| $\,{\textbf{e}}_g$ | gravity unit vector |
| $\phi$ | porosity |
| $\tau$ | deviatoric stress |
| $\mathsf{K}$ | permeability |
| $c$ | solute concentration | 
| $\theta$ | temperature | 
| $\mathsf{D}$ | solutal dispersion |
| $\mathsf{G}$ | thermal dispersion |
