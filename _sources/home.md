# LUCiFEx 😈

Welcome to the *&nbsp;**L**inearized **U**nderground **C**onvection **i**n **FE**niCS**x**&nbsp;* package! 


These demo notebooks are divided into three categories: `A` (applications to fluid dynamics), `F` (foundations of solving PDEs numerically), `N` (numerical methods for solving time-dependent PDEs) and `T` (technical details and testing of the LUCiFEx package).
